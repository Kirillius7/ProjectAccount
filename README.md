# About the project
Data management is a crucial aspect for any business, ensuring proper and efficient utilization of available resources. This project focuses on developing a maintenance tracking system for small business equipment, where repairs must be performed by qualified specialists. The system is particularly relevant for small enterprises that lack large maintenance departments, making efficient planning and optimization of repair processes critical. Such tracking software helps reduce the risk of unexpected equipment failures, increase operational efficiency, save costs, and ensure workplace safety through a systematic approach to maintenance.

# Key Features
- **Role-based access:** Choose between worker and admin roles, with different permissions and views.  
- **Account Management:** User registration, login, and secure authentication.  
- **Service Announcements:** Workers can post messages about available services.  
- **Request Management:** Admins can accept or reject service requests submitted by workers.  
- **Data Visualization:** Interactive charts and graphs using Live Charts for statistics and reporting.  
- **Database Integration:** MySQL database managed via XAMPP for storing users, services, and transactions.  
- **Modern UI/UX:** Built with WPF and Prism for a responsive and maintainable interface.  
- **Efficient Architecture:** Modular structure with Prism for scalable and maintainable code.

# Purpose:
The purpose of this project is to develop a software application for managing repair records, providing functionality for adding, editing, and deleting data across multiple users. The application allows users to view information, process agreements, reject proposals, and generate statistics based on the available data, while implementing a clear user interface, robust database structure, and efficient data processing algorithms.

# Getting Started

## Installation and Launch:
- git clone https://github.com/Kirillius7/ProjectAccount
- Open the solution file (.sln) in Visual Studio
- Restore NuGet packages
- Connect to MySql server to work with data
- Build the solution (Build > Build Solution or Ctrl+Shift+B)
- Run the application (Debug > Start Debugging or F5)

## Working with:
- **User Roles:** select your role as a worker or an admin.
- **Authorization & Registration:** create an account if you donâ€™t have one yet.
